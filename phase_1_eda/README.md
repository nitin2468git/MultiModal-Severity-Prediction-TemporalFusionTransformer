- Identifying risk factors and comorbidities

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python virtual environment activated
- Synthea COVID-19 dataset in `10k_synthea_covid19_csv/` directory
- Required packages installed (see requirements.txt)

### Running the EDA

1. **Navigate to Phase 1 directory**
```bash
cd phase_1_eda
```

2. **Run the EDA script**
```bash
python eda_synthea_covid19.py
```

3. **Check the outputs**
- `outputs/`: Generated data files and reports
- `plots/`: Visualizations and charts
- `logs/`: Execution logs and debugging information

## 🔍 What the EDA Analyzes

### 1. Patient Demographics
- **Age distribution** across the patient population
- **Gender distribution** and balance
- **Race and ethnicity** breakdown
- **Geographic distribution** (if available)

### 2. COVID-19 Specific Analysis
- **COVID-19 patient identification** using condition codes
- **Common COVID-19 conditions** and symptoms
- **Comorbidity patterns** in COVID-19 patients
- **Severity indicators** and risk factors

### 3. Clinical Data Exploration
- **Medication patterns** for COVID-19 treatment
- **Vital signs** and clinical observations
- **Laboratory values** and test results
- **Procedure types** and interventions

### 4. Temporal Analysis
- **Encounter patterns** over time
- **Seasonal trends** in COVID-19 cases
- **Treatment timeline** analysis
- **Patient journey** mapping

### 5. Data Quality Assessment
- **Missing data patterns** across all tables
- **Data completeness** metrics
- **Data consistency** checks
- **Outlier detection** in clinical values

## 📈 Key Insights You'll Discover

### Data Structure Insights
- How many patients have COVID-19 diagnoses
- What types of clinical data are available
- How temporal data is structured
- Data quality and completeness levels

### Clinical Insights
- Most common COVID-19 symptoms and conditions
- Typical medication patterns for COVID-19 treatment
- Vital sign ranges and abnormalities
- Risk factors and comorbidities

### Model Development Insights
- Which features are most relevant for prediction
- How to handle missing data in clinical settings
- Temporal patterns that could inform model design
- Data preprocessing requirements

## 🛠️ Customization Options

### Configuration
Edit `config.yaml` to customize:
- **Data paths** and file locations
- **Analysis parameters** and thresholds
- **Visualization settings** and plot styles
- **Output formats** and file names

### Adding Custom Analyses
You can extend the EDA by:
- Adding new analysis functions to the `SyntheaEDA` class
- Creating custom visualizations for specific insights
- Implementing additional data quality checks
- Adding statistical tests for specific hypotheses

## 🔄 Next Steps

After completing Phase 1, you'll be ready for:
- **Phase 2**: Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Understanding what data cleaning is needed
- Identifying which features to engineer
- Planning the temporal data structure

## 📝 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
